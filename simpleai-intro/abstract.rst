A short introduction to search problems solving, using the SimpleAI python lib.

1. Short introduction to search problems on AI (kind of problems we will be able to solve, restrictions)
2. Live example of solving an AI problem using the lib:
   * Expose the problem
   * Define the problem in python
   * Try several algorithms to find the solution
   * Use the graphical debugger to view the algorithms behaviour
3. Conclusions
4. Where to find more information (book, lib docs, ..)
